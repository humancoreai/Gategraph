# GateGraph

**GateGraph** is a deterministic governance, enforcement, runtime-control and audit proof of concept for agent-like systems.

It evaluates requested actions, applies deterministic rules, issues capability tokens, enforces permissions, applies runtime/session budgets, records decisions in an append-only audit graph, and produces machine-readable evidence logs.

GateGraph is intentionally small. It is not an autonomous agent, not a distributed ledger, and not a full GLP implementation.

---

## What GateGraph does

GateGraph provides:

- deterministic risk classification
- deterministic rule evaluation
- fail-closed decisions
- capability-token-based enforcement
- per-task Runtime Guard
- session/global/agent budget control
- deterministic guard orchestration
- reason normalization for stable explain codes
- append-only event logging
- evidence-oriented JSON test reports
- Pattern Engine proposals without automatic rule changes

The current control flow:

```text
Task
→ Risk Engine
→ Rule Engine
→ Governance Decision
→ Capability Token
→ Enforcement
→ Session Budget Guard
→ Runtime Guard
→ Action-ready / Stop
→ Audit / Evidence
```

---

## What GateGraph does not do

GateGraph currently does **not** provide:

- autonomous rule changes
- production-grade distributed orchestration
- production-grade token signing across IPC/RPC boundaries
- real external tool/API integration (mock adapter only today)
- adaptive budget policy
- full GLP protocol compliance

## Quickstart

```bash
python tests/evidence_ci.py
```

Individual checks:

```bash
python tests/test_loop.py
python tests/runtime_guard_tests.py
python tests/pattern_engine_tests.py
python tests/usage_simulation.py
python tests/unusual_inputs.py
python tests/agent_scenarios.py
python tests/runtime_stress_evidence.py
python tests/session_budget_evidence.py
python tests/guard_orchestration_evidence.py
python tests/reason_normalization_evidence.py
python tests/scale_safety_evidence.py
python tests/external_api_evidence.py
```

Depending on your environment, use `python3` instead of `python`.

## Design principles

- read-only default
- fail closed
- no direct execution without capability token
- Enforcement remains the only action gatekeeper
- guards may stop, but never grant capabilities
- untrusted input is data, never instruction
- decisions are deterministic
- events are append-only
- Pattern Engine creates proposals only
- raw stop reasons are preserved; normalized reasons are additive

---

## Known gaps

- Token signing is not implemented; DB-backed token integrity is suitable only for in-process PoC use.
- External tool/API integration is not implemented.
- Budget policy is static, not adaptive.
- SQLite concurrency handling is improved for session-budget evaluation, but this is still not a distributed transaction system.

## Related concepts

GateGraph is inspired by graph-based and append-only audit models, including GLP-style local audit graph thinking.

Important distinction:

- **GLP** focuses on distributed, content-addressed assertion and relation storage.
- **GateGraph** is a deterministic governance and enforcement layer with an audit graph.

GateGraph does **not** implement the GLP protocol.

## v0.8.5 API Enforcement Binding

External API Adapter now calls Enforcement internally with the provided Capability Token. Callers cannot spoof `enforcement_allowed`. The adapter remains mock-only and performs no real network calls.


## v0.8.6 Runaway / Cost Control Hardening

Non-positive projected/runtime costs now fail closed. See `docs/RUNAWAY_COST_CONTROL.md`.

## v0.8.8 note: Capability Token hardening

Capability Tokens are now HMAC-signed over immutable claims and checked by Enforcement against persisted token state. This protects the current Single-Node model against simple token mutation, forged capability expansion, and persisted signature tampering. See `docs/CAPABILITY_TOKEN_HARDENING.md`.


## Current security hardening note

v0.8.9 adds Capability Token key IDs and keyring-based verification so local HMAC key rotation can be tested deterministically. Unknown signing keys fail closed.


## v0.8.10 hygiene hardening

This release closes review findings without changing product semantics: public keyring accessors replace private imports, enforcement loads trust material once per decision, SECURITY.md and version labels are current, Session Budget schema initialization uses `db/schema.sql` as the DDL source of truth, and test-only/default-secret boundaries are documented.
