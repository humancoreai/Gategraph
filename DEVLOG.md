## v0.4.2

Fixes after 20-run comparative validation:

- added revoked-token DB check in `enforcement.py`
- fixed critical-risk behavior via `RULE-005`
- fixed `data_sensitivity=secret` priority in `risk_engine.py`
- preserved task-binding enforcement
- extended validation to 20 scenarios in isolated and accumulated modes

Validation result:

```text
Passed: isolated 20/20 | accumulated 20/20
Failed: 0
Unexpected allows: 0
Invariant violations: 0
DB events accumulated: 31
```

## v0.4.1
